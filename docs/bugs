Display bugs

Summon - 
"Nothing?? slowly fades into existence."

Messages that should not display are sent to people who are asleep, cannot see because of the dark, or cannot see because of an invisiblity, etc:
Update messages - update.cc (rotting corpse etc)
Movement messages - move.cc ("cannot follow" etc - wisinvis)
Wear messages - wear.cc (invisible objects, invisible person, invisible horse, etc)
Other messages - may exist

Non-singular displays -
Messages that display with the wrong item count.  

All softcode display functions(act_funcs, send_funcs) should convert the $variables with names in the singular form. --but does not.
