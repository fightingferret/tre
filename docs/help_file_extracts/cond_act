SYNTAX

act_func( string, char1, char2, object )

PARAMETERS

string - Driving code of the function, in form "where;condition;text"
         (can be literal string or reference to data string)
char1  - Pointer to char, 'c' target of the function
char2  - Pointer to char, 'v' target of the function
object - Pointer to object, needed if string contains $p referrence

DESCRIPTION

Displays text to various targets evaluating color_codes and variables. 
The various targets are determined by the where and the condition clauses.

WHERE CLAUSE

    'c'    char1
    'v'    char2
    'r'    the room char1 is in
    'R'    the room char2 is in
    'a'    the area char1 is in
    'A'    the area char2 is in
    'g'    global
    'G'    same is above

In addition to ONE of the above, '!' in front of the codes above can be
used for "not to".  "R!c!v" means to the room char2 is in but not char1
or char2.  The object is not used in the where clause so cannot be the
target.  (Please tell me if someone needs otherwise) 

**Don't do anything stupid like "v!v", you WILL get unexpected results.
Note: The global message is only sent to the area if the area is not
open.  The global message is only sent to immortal rooms if the area is
an immortal area.

CONDITION CLAUSE

See 'help check_cond'

In this case, 'c' in check_cond is char1 and 'v' in check_cond is the
person to sees the message.

ie. cond_act( "r;Lv>Lc;$n tries to hide.", ch );
Everyone in the same room as char1 sees "Whoever tries to hide." if their
level higher than char1's.

By default, all act_func() does not send the message to people who are
sleeping.  In cond_act(), this can be achieved by adding a "Pv>4"
condition or "Sv".  (the later also checks if the person is blind)

RETURNS

none
